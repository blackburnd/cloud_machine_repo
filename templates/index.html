                         <p>Hello there, </p>
                        <p>My name is Daniel Blackburn and I have a couple decades of experience solving problems and architecting solutions with technology. A few things about me is that I enjoy solving complex problems with forward thinking smart kind people, creating time saving toolsets, and validating confidence with test coverage. I belive life is good and life gets better when you actively try to make life easier for tomorrow.  I believe continuous improvement, clear communication, empathy and kindness keeps us all from working in hard mode, and I know that understanding the limitations and abilities of your environment and team is invaluable information. I continue to appreciate foundational knowledge learned through curiosity, trial, and effective communication. I thrive avoiding the all too common overconfidence related mistakes by maintining an practice of a lifelong academic who always has something to learn, and is never afraid of being wrong.</p>

                        <p> Its a terribly exiting time to be skilled in software with all these new tools coming out often, AI agentic programming is testing my four letter vocabulary and interpretation of patience, as i hone the converational skills with these new products. In that academic spirit I decided as an academic excersize to imerse myself in Google's Cloud platform, VSCode, CI/CD and co-pilot agents in git. From a person used to terminal console and powering through with emacs and a pdb this has been a educational change.
			  I am impressed daily by what is possible by these tools in the right hands, and how much can go wrong so quickly while learning. </p>

			<p>This portfolio site is the result of that imersion to advertise some of my abilities more in depth than just a resume submission, so this was a perfect opportunity to learn a handful of new technologies, and framwork integrations. In fact this site, is the imersion project. 
The domain was purchased from squarespace, routed to Google Cloud flask based postgresql backed python app that uses google oauth2 for authentication and authorization to admin mode. Nginx handles the middleware, and intetgration with google's gmail API allows the contact form emails to be sent. The site is runnin  GCP on a virtual instance, with CI/CD integration configured to the public repo on github. </p>

			<p>Most of the functionality added to this site I had written in some for or another manually, Watching the agentic programmer work, and forcing interruptions to stay on track  has been an increasingly interesting thing to witness.</p>

                        <p> Up until recently 99% of all my software would be written in a terminal emacs, but in todays world of options, that narrows the set tools. Development environments mimicking the actual production system either VM or metal would make for a more efficient transition to emergency fix mode, if an when a production issue would occur. Navigation and development are impressively efficient in emacs, but limits the developer tool options availale
