                        <p>Hello there, </p>
                        <p>From understaffed university shops to the corporate banking cube farm to lightweight agile development teams, I continue to appreciate foundational knowledge learned through trial, and experience and effective communication. I thrive avoiding the all too common overconfidence related mistakes by maintining an practice of a lifelong academic who always has something to learn.</p>

                        <p>Building solutions are easy, building solutions better is rewarding, solutions based performance enhancements are addictive.</p>

                        <p> Its a terribly exiting time to be skilled in software with new tools coming out often, and new AI agents testing my four letter vocabulary and interpretation of patience I decided as an academic excersize to imerse myself in Google's Cloud platform, CI/CD and co-pilot agents in git, as well as vscode. From a person used to terminal console and powering through with emacs and a pdb this has been a change. I am impressed daily by what is possible by these tools in the right hands, and how much can go wrong so quickly while learning. </p>

                        <p>
                            Python has always been my primary language for solving solutions as well as paying the bills, and often the process to 
                            implement the Correct solution is something other than python.
                        </p>

                        <p> I am a big fan of virtualization and making life easier tomorrow. Historically my development environment would be a VMWare version whatever the production
                            was running on,and my development environment would be an emacs session in a SSH terminal, almost identical to a production SSH terminal, This was so emergency
                            debugging would be efficient, and was all too common in some shops. This also led me to build a python interepreter analog I would use as an admin on our site that
                             saved countless hours, and was a real fun and helpful project.
                        </p>
