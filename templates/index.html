                        <h2>Building Better Solutions Through Experience</h2>
                        <p>From university IT departments to corporate banking environments to agile remote startups, I've learned that foundational knowledge combined with effective communication creates lasting impact. I thrive by avoiding overconfidence through continuous learning—always maintaining the mindset of a lifelong academic.</p>
                        <p><em>Building is easy. Building things better is rewarding. Evidence-based performance enhancements are addictive.</em></p>

                        <!-- About Me Section -->
                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>With over two decades of experience solving problems and architecting solutions, I appreciate the deep knowledge that comes from curiosity, trial, and hands-on problem solving. My career has taken me through diverse environments where I've learned that the best solutions often require looking beyond the obvious tools.</p>
                        
                        <p>I enjoy working with forward-thinking, collaborative teams to create time-saving toolsets and validate confidence through comprehensive test coverage. Practicing continuous improvement with clear communication, kindness, and empathy keeps me from working in hard mode. Understanding the limitations and abilities of my environment and team is often invaluable.</p>

                        <!-- Current Focus Section -->
                        <h3>Embracing the AI Revolution</h3>
                        <p>Things are changing fast, and it's a terribly exciting time to be skilled in software development—especially when you know what "correct" looks like. I liken using AI as a pair programmer to having my own "honesty-impaired Djinn" for software. It's constantly lying, but AI can absolutely provide valuable solutions with very explicit instructions on guardrails, oversight, and follow-up.</p>
                        
                        <p>With proper constraints, I've learned to create some pretty cool solutions—but only if AI has a short leash. Letting it run wild is a mistake and a new type of frustrating experience that expands both vocabulary and patience.</p>

                        <h3>This Site: A Technical Showcase</h3>
                        <p>As an academic exercise born from the need to advocate for my skillset beyond what a simple resume could offer, I created this OAuth2-authenticating, LinkedIn-integrated site. This project allowed me to immerse myself in Google's Cloud Platform, VSCode, CI/CD, and Copilot agents to advertise my skills in depth.</p>
                        
                        <p>This site is the result of a few weeks of that immersion—a perfect opportunity to learn new technologies and framework integrations. The site runs on Google Cloud Platform with a virtual instance, backed by a PostgreSQL cloud instance, and topped off with CI/CD integration configured to a public GitHub repository.</p>
