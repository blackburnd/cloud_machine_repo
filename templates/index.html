                         <p>Hello there, </p>
                        <p>My name is Daniel Blackburn and I have a couple decades of experience solving problems and architecting solutions with technology. I enjoy solving complex problems with forward thinking smart kind people, creating time saving toolsets, and validating confidence with test coverage. I belive life is good and life gets better when you actively try to improve tomorrow. Practicing continuous improvement with clear communication, kindness and empathy keeps me from working in hard mode and understanding the limitations and abilities of my environment,  team and how to efficiently interact is often invaluable. I continue to appreciate foundational knowledge learned through curiosity, trial, and effective communication and I thrive avoiding the all too common overconfidence related mistakes by maintining an practice of a lifelong academic who always has something to learn, and am never afraid of being wrong.</p>
                        <p> Things are changing fast, and its a terribly exciting time to be skilled in software development and to actually know what correct looks like. Unfortunately for some, proofing AI solutions is becoming easier to create and deploy than writing from scratch and the payment for those hidden defects will be expensive to repair from generated code. I liken using AI as a pair programmer or agent team as to having my own "honesty impaired Djinn" for software. Its constantly lying and AI can absolutely provide valuable solutions, but not without very explicit instructions on guardrailing, oversight and followup.  With this I have learned to create some pretty cool solutions but only if AI has a short leash. Letting it run wild and take the reigns is a mistake and new type of frustrating experience expanding my four letter vocabulary and interpretation of patience.</p>

</p>As an academic excersize born from the need to advocate for my skillset more than a simple resume could offer, I created this site, an OAuth2 authenticating, LinkedIn reading site and  was able to imerse myself in Google's Cloud platform, VSCode, CI/CD and co-pilot agents in git to  advertise my skills.</p>

<p>This site is the result of a few weekes in that imersion to expose and advertise some of my abilities more in depth than just a resume submission, so this was a perfect opportunity to learn a handful of new technologies, and framwork integrations.
  The site is running on Google Cloud Platform on a virtual instance, backed by postgresql cloud instance topped off with CI/CD integration configured to the public repo on github. It was a pretty fun and interesting project and is available in github.
  Grab the source or go here and take a look at the showcase page for an overview of the functionality.
