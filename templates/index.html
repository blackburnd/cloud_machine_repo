                        <p>Hello there, </p>
                        <p>My name is Daniel Blackburn, life is good and I belive life usually gets better when you make life easier for tomorrow.
			  I enjoy solving complex problems with forward thinking smart and kind people, creating time saving toolsets, and validating confidence with test coverage. I believe continuous improvement, clear communication, empathy and kindness keeps us all from working in hard mode, as well as understanding the limitations and abilities of your environment. I continue to appreciate foundational knowledge learned through trial, and experience and effective communication. I thrive avoiding the all too common overconfidence related mistakes by maintining an practice of a lifelong academic who always has something to learn.</p>

                        <p>Building a solution is easy, building solutions better is rewarding, solutions based performance enhancements are addictive.</p>

                        <p> Its a terribly exiting time to be skilled in software with new tools coming out often, and new AI agents testing my four letter vocabulary and interpretation of patience I decided as an academic excersize to imerse myself in Google's Cloud platform, CI/CD and co-pilot agents in git, as well as vscode. From a person used to terminal console and powering through with emacs and a pdb this has been a change. I am impressed daily by what is possible by these tools in the right hands, and how much can go wrong so quickly while learning. </p>


                        <p> Up until recently 99% of all my software would be written in a terminal emacs, but in todays world of options, that narrows the set tools. Development environments mimicking the actual production system either VM or metal would make for a more efficient transition to emergency fix mode, if an when a production issue would occur. Navigation and development are impressively efficient in emacs, but limits the developer tool options availale
