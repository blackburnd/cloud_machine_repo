                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>With over two decades of experience solving problems and architecting solutions, I appreciate
the deep knowledge that comes from curiosity, trial, and hands-on problem solving. My career
has taken me through diverse environments where I&#39;ve learned that the best solutions often
require looking beyond the obvious tools.</p>
                
                <p>I enjoy working with forward-thinking, collaborative teams to create time-saving toolsets and
validate confidence through comprehensive test coverage. Practicing continuous improvement
with clear communication, kindness, and empathy helps me work smarter and more
sustainably. Equally important is appreciating the strengths and limitations of my environment
and team, which provides invaluable perspective.</p>

                <h3>Embracing the AI Revolution</h3>
                <p>Things are changing fast, and it's an incredibly exciting time to be skilled in software
development—especially when you have a clear sense of what 'correct' looks like. I think of
using AI as a pair programmer like working with a mischievous djinn: it's resourceful but often
unreliable, yet with clear guardrails, good oversight, and thoughtful follow-up, it can provide
surprisingly valuable solutions.
</p>

                <p>With the right constraints, I've found AI can help create some genuinely useful solutions, but
only when kept on a short leash. Letting it run unchecked quickly turns into a new kind of
frustration, one that tends to stretch both patience and vocabulary. Even with its quirks, I'm
excited to keep exploring how to use AI more effectively; it's a tool I'm still learning from, and
the journey itself is part of the reward.
