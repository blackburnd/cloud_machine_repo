        <p>Hello</p>
        <p>From small university shops to corporate banking cube farm to lightweight agile 100% remote positions in profit shops.</p>
        <p>I appreciate foundational knowledge learned through trial, and experience and effective communication. I thrive avoiding the
            all too common overconfidence related mistakes by maintining an practice of a lifelong academic who always has something
            to learn.

        <p>Building is easy, building things better is rewarding, evidence based performance enhancements are addictive.</p>

        <p> Its really an exciting time to be skilled in the area most affected by AI. In my spare time i have been learning
            Google's Cloud platform, and co-pilot agents in git, as well as vscode. From a person who uses emacs for 99% 
            of all programming tasks and has written most of the point and click functionality from scratch, I am impressed daily
            by what is possible by these tools in the right hands. </p>

        <p>
            Python has always been my primary language for solving solutions as well as paying the bills, and often the process to 
            get the deliverable results match with the task at hand. When one language will not cut it for delivery solutions,
            especially when you have little time, you grab the tools that work the best for the customer.
